The Project Report should begin with the group identification and the names and USP numbers of all students in the group. The Project Report has to have the following sections:

Requirements: The requirements are given in the assignment, but you have to add any new requirements needed by your particular store implementation.

Project Description: Describe how your project implements the functionality in the requirements. Diagrams can help a lot here.

Comments About the Code: Any comment you may want to add to help understand your code. This is good programming practice.

Test Plan: Text describing the tests that will be performed. If an automatic test tool/framework is used (ex: Selenium, JUnit, Spock), the code for the tests can be used.

Test Results: Text describing the test results. If an automatic test tool/framework is used, its output can be used.

Build Procedures: A step-by-step guide to run your code. You should start telling how to install whatever software you need, then how to download/build your program, and finally how to set up the environment to run it. Imagine that someone installing will just follow these commands (nothing more).

Problems: List any major problems you had.

Comments: Any comments you wish to add.

At this first milestone, you will probably only have material for the first two topics. But include the other topics, even if you leave them empty, and, if possible, write how you plan to implement them. For instance, for testing, you may say I intend to use the postman to test the back end, etc.

Do not forget to include in the Project Description:
The functionalities you are going to implement.
Navigation diagram for your application linked to the screen mockups. This link can be just the name of the mockup (i.e. Mockup1, Mockup2, etc) or an HTML link.
The information you are going to save in the server (no need to decide how that information will be saved).
At this stage, do not focus on producing beautiful user interfaces (UIs) but rather think about what kinds of interfaces you will need and what information each interface needs to show and to ask from the user. Also, think about how the users should navigate your app to accomplish their tasks (such as buying a product, registering, etc).

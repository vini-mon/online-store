## Project Report



#### Requirements
The requirements are given in the assignment, but you have to add any new requirements needed by your particular store implementation.

#### Project Description
Describe how your project implements the functionality in the requirements. Diagrams can help a lot here.

#### Comments About the Code
Any comment you may want to add to help understand your code. This is good programming practice.

#### Test Plan
Text describing the tests that will be performed. If an automatic test tool/framework is used (ex: Selenium, JUnit, Spock), the code for the tests can be used.

#### Test Results
Text describing the test results. If an automatic test tool/framework is used, its output can be used.

#### Build Procedures
A step-by-step guide to run your code. You should start telling how to install whatever software you need, then how to download/build your program, and finally how to set up the environment to run it. Imagine that someone installing will just follow these commands (nothing more).

#### Problems
List any major problems you had.

#### Comments
Any comments you wish to add.
